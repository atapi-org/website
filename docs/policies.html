          Monthly consultations, in cases where they are provided as a

          researcher-subjects are either on course or in seclusion.
          Monthly consultations not taken within the scope of any
          given calendar month are considered forfeit.
          Missed monthly consultations do not roll over to the following
          month and are not cumulative.
        </p>

        <h2>Cancellation Policy</h2>

        <p>
          Sponsor memberships are billed continuously (monthly).
          Under normal circumstances, refunds will not be provided.
          If a sponsorship payment is made in error, a refund for that
          month's payment can be requested by emailing
          <a href="mailto:atari@atapi.org">atari@atapi.org</a>.
